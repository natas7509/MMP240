                <p>Producer, occasional vocalist, and DJ Little Bell hails from Irkutsk, Siberia. Kraviz fell under the
                    spell of house music during the mid-‘90s through radio. A few years later, she moved to Moscow for
                    the sake of studying dentistry, and was briefly part of a trio called MySpaceRocket. The group
                    released one 12”, 2007’s “Amok,” a lean house track with a deep bassline and Kraviz’s breathy
                    vocals; the B-side featured a version from U.K. DJ legend Greg Wilson. Kraviz subsequently went solo
                    and made a splash in 2009, when she issued productions on Efdemin’s Naïf, Jus-Ed’s Underground
                    Quality, and Matt Edwards’ Rekids. This noise pop duo from Brooklyn, Alex Krauss and Derek Edward
                    Miller, tear it up with their 4th studio effort, “Jessica Rabbit”. Singles “Rule Number One” and
                    “Hyper Dark” were released this year in June and July respectively. This latest effort will be
                    released November 11, 2018 on their own label, Torn Clean (also a track off of the album). </p>

                    From the beginning, Miller and Krauss set high expectations for themselves, with the goal to make a
                    living off of their music. Krauss noted that when the two began recording together for the first
                    time, Miller wanted to be in control. "It was like a really interesting session gig for me...I
                    always knew it was Derek's thing — he was producing and writing the songs. He had very specific
                    ideas about what the synth sounds should be like.It’s been 3 years since The Josh Brothers released
                    “Bitter Rivals”, their 3rd studio album. This noise pop duo from Brooklyn, Alex Krauss and Derek
